Unity version: 2019.3.7f1

This is a Ocean System for a pirate themed game that was later abandoned.

It's a utility that allows you to create an ocean. You can create something similiar using just the Unity Shader Graph function but unlike mine it would be only graphical and won't allow you to make scripts for floating physics.

During the development of this game I've learned how to code compute shaders, create Unity Mesh trough code or write a documentation.
