### Hi, I'm Kamil ðŸ‘‹

I've just finished high school and I'm currently trying to find something I will do in the upcoming years.

I like programming, because there's always some problem that has to be resolved, therefore there's always something new and it never gets boring. I also love playing games and because of that I like creating them.

Me and my friends have already tried to develop some games, but it all failed due to lack of motivation and free time from some of the team members.

I've had a part-time job as a tester and programmer at Radixon. I've worked there two years in a row for 1 month during the summer holiday.

You can find my finished and unfinished projects in this repository.
